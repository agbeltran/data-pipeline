The sample data are presented in 213 population tables (matrices) and 110 housing tables, identified with \"PCT\" and \"HCT\", respectively. Each table is iterated for 336 population groups: the total population, 132 race groups, 78 American Indian and Alaska Native tribe categories (reflecting 39\nindividual tribes), 39 Hispanic or Latino groups, and 86 ancestry groups. SF 4 is released as individual files for each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; and for the United States. The tables (matrices) are identical for all files, but the geographic coverage differs. Data are provided down to the census tract level.\n</p>"}]}, {"keyword": [{"keywordVocabulary": "ODUM:INDEX.TERMS", "keywordValue": "Demographic data"}]}, {"topicClassification": [{"topicClassValue": "Census", "topicClassVocab": "ODUM:MAIN.HEADING"}]}, {"notesText": "Subject: null  Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER  Notes: 14-1-2000-SF4-NC1-CD; Subject: null  Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER  Notes: 14-1-2000-SF4-NC2-CD; Subject: null  Type: ODUM:CODEBOOK.NUMBER  Notes: 14-1-2000-SF4-NC3-CD;"}, {"producer": [{"producerName": "U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Data User Services Division"}]}, {"productionDate": "2003-06"}, {"productionPlace": "Washington, DC"}], "displayName": "Citation Metadata"}}
