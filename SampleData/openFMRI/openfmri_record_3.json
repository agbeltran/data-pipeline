  "description": "<p>Subjects were scanned while incidentally encoding a series of visually presented real objects and greebles (meaningless objects) in a variant of the Posner cueing paradigm. Subjects covertly shifted their attention to the left or right of fixation, as cued by a centrally-presented arrow prior to item onset, and made a real object versus greeble judgment about the stimulus appearing in the cued or uncued location. Items appeared in the uncued location with a probability of .18. Subjects performed an unscanned memory test following encoding, in which they indicated their memory for old and new real objects using the following four responses: high confident old, low confident old, low confident new, high confident new. For trials in which subjects responded with one of the two old responses, a source memory judgment about the location (left or right side of the screen) of the object at study followed the recognition judgment.<\/p>",
