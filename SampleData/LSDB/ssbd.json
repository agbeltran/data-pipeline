SSBD provides a wide variety of quantitative data from single-molecules to cell to organism in different species. A web browser based multidimensional visualization tool is available for viewing quantitative data interactively online.","Features and manner of utilization of database":"The data are provided in the Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML) format, which is a unified format for representing quantitative data of biological dynamics. The quantitative data are provided through REST API, which allows third parties to develop their applications. In addition, SSBD also provides software tools for data visualization and analysis with time-lapse microscopy images from which the quantitative data were obtained.","Background and funding":{"name":[]},"Reference(s)":{"Article title":"Biological Dynamics Markup Language (BDML): an open format for representing quantitative biological dynamics data","Author name(s)":"Koji Kyoda, Yukako Tohsato, Kenneth H.
