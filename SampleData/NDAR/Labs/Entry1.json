The most salient SIB risk factors historically studied within developmental disorders are level of intellectual disability, communication deficits and presence of specific genetic disorders. Recent SIB research has expanded the search for risk factors to include less commonly studied variables for people with developmental disorders: negative affect, hyperactivity and impulsivity.",

                "Description":"An automated pipeline was developed to reference Neuroimages hosted by the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and derive volumes for distinct brain structures using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the Configurable-Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) platform. This pipeline utilized the ANTs cortical thickness methodology discuessed in \"Large-Scale Evaluation of ANTs and Freesurfer Cortical Tchickness Measurements\" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879923] to extract a cortical thickness volume from T1-weighted anatomical MRI data gathered from the NDAR database. This volume was then registered to an stereotaxic-space anatomical template (OASIS-30 Atropos Template) which was acquired from the Mindboggle Project webpage [http://mindboggle.info/data.html]. After registration, the mean cortical thickness was calculated at 31 ROIs on each hemisphere of the cortex and using the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT-31) cortical labelling protocol [http://mindboggle.info/faq/labels.html] over the OASIS-30 template.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: This study is ongoing; additional data my be available in the future.**\r\n\r\nAs a result, each subject that was processed has a cortical thickness volume image and a text file with the mean thickness ROIs (in mm) stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3). Additionally, these results were tabulated in an AWS-hosted database (through NDAR) to enable simple, efficient querying and data access.\r\n\r\nAll of the code used to perform this analysis is publicly available on Github [https://github.com/FCP-INDI/ndar-dev]. Additionally, as a computing platform, we developed an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that comes fully equipped to run this pipeline on any dataset. Using AWS Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2), users can launch our publicly available AMI (\"C-PAC with benchmark\", AMI ID: \"ami-fee34296\", N. Virginia region) and run the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline. The AMI is fully compatible with Sun Grid Engine as well; this enables users to perform many pipeline runs in parallel over a cluster-computing framework.",

The SCQ is recommended for individuals between 4 to 40 years with a cutoff score of 15 for referral. Mixed findings have been reported regarding the recommended cutoff score\u2019s ability to accurately classify an individual as at-risk for ASD (sensitivity) versus an individual as not at-risk for ASD (specificity). Based on a sample from the National Database for Autism Research (n=344; age: 1.58 to 25.92 years old), the present study examined the SCQ\u2019s sensitivity versus specificity across a range of ages. We recommend that the cutoff scores for the SCQ be re-evaluated with age as a consideration.\nLay Abstract\nThe age neutrality of the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) was examined as a common screener for ASD. Mixed findings have been reported regarding the recommended cutoff score\u2019s ability to accurately classify an individual as at-risk for ASD (sensitivity) versus accurately classifying an individual as not at-risk for ASD (specificity). With a sample from the National Database for Autism Research, the present study examined the SCQ\u2019s sensitivity versus specificity. Analyses indicated that the actual sensitivity and specificity scores were lower than initially reported by the creators of the SCQ.",

A combination of Item Response Theory and Mokken scaling techniques were utilized to achieve this and abbreviated scoring of the SCQ is suggested. The psychometric sensitivity of this abbreviated SCQ was examined via bootstrapped Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Additionally, we examined the sensitivity of the abbreviated and total scaled SCQ as it relates to a potential diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SCD). As SCD is a new disorder introduced with the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), we identified individuals with potential diagnosis of SCD among individuals with ASD via mixture modeling techniques using the same NDAR data. These analyses revealed two classes or clusters of individuals when considering the two core areas of impairment among individuals with ASD: social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior.",

                "Description":"LONI utilized de-identified data from NDAR's cloud and a LONI Pipeline (pipeline.loni.usc.edu) processing workflow to perform a secondary structural MRI examination. The workflow used in this study pulls data from and provided by NDAR to an instance on the LONI compute cluster, aligns data to a standard orientation using FSLreorient2stsd, and undergoes further image processing to eventually identify, extract, and analyze cortical and sub-cortical structures in different MRI brain volumes. Two methods were used for this image processing: the first uses Freesurfer Recon_All to extract brain cortical parcellation and surfaces, align the data to an atlas, and identify, and analyze regions of interest; the second uses FSL to extract the brain (BET), align the data to an atlas, and extract ROIs including sub-cortical regions using FSL FIRST. The second method also uses Freesurfer (mri_segstats) to perform statistical analysis of these ROIs. Lastly, the LONI Pipeline workflow updates and returns the data processed and extracted by Freesurfer and FSL as a miNDAR back to NDAR's cloud storage instance.  These results can be used to assess quality control or be used to perform post-hoc comparisons of cortical and sub-cortical brain architecture between subject types.  See also, Torgerson et al. (2015) Brain Imaging and Behavior, for additional details on using LONI Pipeline to access and process NDAR data.",

        "Description":"The UIC ACE was focused on the genetics, neurobiology, cognitive and affective processes, and pharmacology of insistence on sameness (IS) in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A large sample of children with self-reported autism spectrum disorder will be screened by the Assessment Core for further screening by administration of the ADI-R to the parents. Profanes meeting ADI-R criteria for autistic disorder will be recruited for further study if they are also classified by the ADI-R IS items as high (N=150) or low IS (N=100). In addition, high IS subjects will need to score 15 or more on the sum of two IS factors on the RBS-R to avoid floor effects for the pharmacogenetic trial. These 250 subjects will all be included in project I, Genetics of Serotonin in Autism: Neurochemical and Clinical Endophenotypes, along with 225 previously studied subjects and their parents for a total of 475 trios. This project will study 25 serotonin- related genes for association with autism and with IS more specifically. Resequencing of strong candidate genes will be conducted with all of the subjects in the pharmacogenetic project (III) and with the low IS subjects in project II. In addition, the 250 subjects will have serotonin measures collected for analysis with genetic and phenotype measures. In Project II: Translational Studies of Cognitive, Affective and Neurochemical Processes Underlying Insistence on Sameness in Autism, fMRI studies of IS will be conducted on 50 high IS subjects also in Project III, 50 low IS subjects (also in Project I) and 50 control subjects. In addition, rat studies in which parallel behavioral and neurochemical approaches will be used. Project III: The Pharmacogenetics of Treatment for Insistence on Sameness in Autism has been designed to replicate and extend a preliminary study of escitalopram treatment of IS related irritability in ASD. Project IV: Autism-Associated Serotonin Transporter (SERT) Mutations will provide characterization of mutations previously found to be associated with high IS behaviors in subjects with autism.",
