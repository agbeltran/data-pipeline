                "Description":"An automated pipeline was developed to reference Neuroimages hosted by the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and derive volumes for distinct brain structures using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the Configurable-Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) platform. This pipeline utilized the ANTs cortical thickness methodology discuessed in \"Large-Scale Evaluation of ANTs and Freesurfer Cortical Tchickness Measurements\" [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879923] to extract a cortical thickness volume from T1-weighted anatomical MRI data gathered from the NDAR database. This volume was then registered to an stereotaxic-space anatomical template (OASIS-30 Atropos Template) which was acquired from the Mindboggle Project webpage [http://mindboggle.info/data.html]. After registration, the mean cortical thickness was calculated at 31 ROIs on each hemisphere of the cortex and using the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT-31) cortical labelling protocol [http://mindboggle.info/faq/labels.html] over the OASIS-30 template.\n\n**NOTE: This study is ongoing; additional data my be available in the future.**\n\nAs a result, each subject that was processed has a cortical thickness volume image and a text file with the mean thickness ROIs (in mm) stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3). Additionally, these results were tabulated in an AWS-hosted database (through NDAR) to enable simple, efficient querying and data access.\n\nAll of the code used to perform this analysis is publicly available on Github [https://github.com/FCP-INDI/ndar-dev]. Additionally, as a computing platform, we developed an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that comes fully equipped to run this pipeline on any dataset. Using AWS Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2), users can launch our publicly available AMI (\"C-PAC with benchmark\", AMI ID: \"ami-fee34296\", N. Virginia region) and run the ANTs cortical thickness pipeline. The AMI is fully compatible with Sun Grid Engine as well; this enables users to perform many pipeline runs in parallel over a cluster-computing framework.",

                "Description":"LONI utilized de-identified data from NDAR's cloud and a LONI Pipeline (pipeline.loni.usc.edu) processing workflow to perform a secondary structural MRI examination. The workflow used in this study pulls data from and provided by NDAR to an instance on the LONI compute cluster, aligns data to a standard orientation using FSLreorient2stsd, and undergoes further image processing to eventually identify, extract, and analyze cortical and sub-cortical structures in different MRI brain volumes. Two methods were used for this image processing: the first uses Freesurfer Recon_All to extract brain cortical parcellation and surfaces, align the data to an atlas, and identify, and analyze regions of interest; the second uses FSL to extract the brain (BET), align the data to an atlas, and extract ROIs including sub-cortical regions using FSL FIRST. The second method also uses Freesurfer (mri_segstats) to perform statistical analysis of these ROIs. Lastly, the LONI Pipeline workflow updates and returns the data processed and extracted by Freesurfer and FSL as a miNDAR back to NDAR's cloud storage instance.  These results can be used to assess quality control or be used to perform post-hoc comparisons of cortical and sub-cortical brain architecture between subject types.  See also, Torgerson et al. (2015) Brain Imaging and Behavior, for additional details on using LONI Pipeline to access and process NDAR data.",
