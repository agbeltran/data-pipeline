        "Description":"The Yale ACE consists of 5 project areas and 3 core resources. Projects I, II, and III focus on the same cohort of 12- to 24-month old infants with ASD followed up longitudinally. Project IV involves structural and functional neuroimaging protocols on a group of 10-year-olds with ASD who were extensively characterized at the age of 2 and 4 years. Project V includes cytogenetic studies of the infants evaluated in Projects I, II, and III, and the ASD children evaluated in Project IV. The Administrative Core is charged with planning, oversight, and management of the Yale ACE. The Assessment Core ensures that all project areas have access to well-characterized patients, family members and control populations, from a behavioral/phenotypic standpoint and from a medical/pediatric and genetics standpoint. The Data Management and Analysis provides data management and data analytic expertise across projects.",
