We crossed UAS-Brm-IR males with Hs-Gal4 females to generate the transgenic strain containing UAS-Brm-IR and Hs-Gal4 for Brm knockdown (experimental group, short for BrmIR). Similarly, the transgenic strain containing UAS-mCD8GFP and Hs-Gal4 (control group, short for GFP) was generated by crossing UAS-mCD8GFP males with Hs-Gal4 females and expected to remove the influence of UAS-Gal4 system. Both control and experimental group flies were cultured at normal temperature (25C) for 83.5h (i.e., the third larvae stage) after fertilization. Next, they were cultured at 37C for 30 min to knockdown Brm by the expression of Brm shRNA through heatshock in waterbath, and followed recovery at 25C for 4.5hr. Repeat the heatshock-and-recovery treatment twice, but with recovery time of 3.5hr and 2hr, respectively. Then, the larvae were collected and used in this study. These two groups of flies were denoted as GFP37 and BrmIR37, respectively. Meanwhile, the two groups of flies were cultured at 25C all the time in parallel after fertilization as negative controls. These flies were denoted as GFP25 and BrmIR25, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from 95-99h larvae using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed on 500ng of total RNA in 10uL reaction system for each sample using PrimeScript RT Master Mix Perfect Real Time Kit (TAKARA, Code: DRR036A). The Realtime PCR was carried out in triplicate using F-416L DyNAmoTM ColorFlash SYBR Green qPCR Kit (Thermo).
