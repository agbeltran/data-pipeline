We examined ICRmax performance on our own sequencing data derived from six rectal tumors achieving an average accuracy of 70% for ICR identification. ICRmax allows the identification of interchromosomal translocations from low-coverage (3x) sequenced tumor genomes, eliminates the need to sequence a matched normal tissue genome."},
