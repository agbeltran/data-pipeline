Understanding the critical mutational events underlying the development of cancer is paramount for advancing prevention, early detection and effective treatment of the disease. Extraordinary recent advances in sequencing now make it a realistic aim to sequence large numbers of cancer genomes to find somatic mutations on a massive scale."},
